## Graal 0.3.0 - (2022-06-02)

**New features:**

 * Dependencies file for development\
   Include a new requirements.txt file to install the development version
   from the repositories.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix error in update worktree\
   Graal wasn't working with the latest version of Git 2.35.1 because it
   protects braches checked out in all worktrees. This change renames the
   branch created when creating a worktree to fix the issue.

**Feature removals:**

 * Drop Python 3.6 support\
   Python 3.6 reached the end of life at the end of 2021. This means it
   won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
   Therefore, this package will only work with Python >= 3.7 from now on.
